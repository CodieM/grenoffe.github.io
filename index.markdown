## Welcome

Here you will find some samples of *personal* projects that I've had the pleasure of working on. Enjoy!

## Games

### Ghosty Boi

A top down action/adventure game where you play as a ghost who helps a lost adventurer escape from a dangerous cave. Working with a small group, I did most of the programming for this project, while my team members worked on art, level design, and storytelling!

### Blockus

A recreation of a classic board game that has the player take turns placing tetris like blocks on a shared board, competing to occupy as much space as possible on the board! Developed with in c++ using SFML. Worked in a team, I primarily worked on the overall structure of the program, while my team members were responsible for UI and AI.

### Mini Projects

Smaller in scope and with a focus on learning are my personal projects. These are largely prototypes that I use as jumping of points for collaboration with fellow game creators, as well as just a chance for me to explore some genre of interest to me. These projects include:

- Boids: Exploring flocking behaviour ![Boids](https://media.giphy.com/media/oFFGYuShLwrc9sl621/giphy.gif)
- Procedural Playground: "dungeon" generation and procedural IK "walking" ![Example Generated Dungeon](https://i.imgur.com/RM8AXtw.png)
- RTS Prototype: Building a very basic framework for RTS games in Unity.
